# Phase Summaries

This directory contains detailed summaries and metrics for each phase of the Context Engineering project.

## Phase Structure

Each phase summary includes:
- **Objectives**: What we aimed to achieve
- **Implementation Details**: Key components and decisions
- **Metrics Comparison**: Quantitative improvements over previous phase
- **Key Findings**: Insights and discoveries
