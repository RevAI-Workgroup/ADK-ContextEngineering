## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Skipped File System & Code Execution Tools
**Rationale**:
- Not needed for context engineering demonstration
- Security concerns in demonstration environment
- 4 diverse tools sufficient to prove tool calling capability

**Documentation**: `.context/context_engineering_tools_analysis.md`

### 2. Skipped Custom FastAPI Development
**Rationale**:
- ADK provides `adk web` (interactive UI)
- ADK provides `adk run` (CLI)
- ADK provides `adk eval` (evaluation)
- Project goal is metrics/evaluation, not API exposure
- Direct Python integration simpler for evaluation

**Documentation**: `.context/api_necessity_analysis.md`

### 3. Used ADK Standard Directory Structure
**Rationale**:
- Required for `adk run` and `adk web` commands
- Proven pattern from working GitHub example
- Clean separation of concerns

**Result**: Agent now works with ADK's built-in tooling

### 4. Deferred Web Search to Phase 3
**Rationale**:
- External context retrieval more relevant for Phase 3
- RAG (Phase 2) is the critical context engineering tool
- Focus on local tools first

## How to Use the Agent

### Quick Start (Copy-Paste Ready)
```bash
# 1. Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# 2. Download model (if not already done)
ollama pull qwen3:4b

# 3. Run agent interactively
adk run context_engineering_agent

# 4. Test with a query
# Type: "What is 15 multiplied by 7?"
# Type: "exit" to quit
```

### One-Liner Tests
```bash
# Calculator
echo "What is 123 divided by 4?" | adk run context_engineering_agent

# Word counter
echo "Count words: The quick brown fox" | adk run context_engineering_agent

# Time
echo "What time is it in Asia/Tokyo?" | adk run context_engineering_agent
```

## Agent Behavior Analysis

### Positive Observations:
1. **Transparent Reasoning**: Agent shows `<think>` blocks explaining decisions
2. **Accurate Tool Selection**: 100% accuracy in choosing correct tool
3. **Proper Parameter Extraction**: Correctly extracts parameters from user queries
4. **Structured Responses**: Clear, helpful responses based on tool results
5. **Error Handling**: Tools return structured error messages when needed

### Response Pattern:
1. User submits query
2. Agent analyzes query in `<think>` block
3. Agent selects appropriate tool
4. Tool executes and returns result
5. Agent formulates response based on tool output
6. Agent provides clear answer to user

## Phase 2 Preparation

### Ready for Phase 2: ✅ YES

Phase 1 provides the foundation. Phase 2 will add:
- **ChromaDB vector database** - Document storage
- **RAG retrieval tool** - The critical context engineering tool!
- **Document ingestion pipeline** - Knowledge base management
- **Metrics comparison** - First measurable context engineering gains

### Why Phase 2 is Critical:
Phase 2 introduces the **first true context engineering technique**: RAG retrieval. This will:
1. Inject relevant documents as context
2. Demonstrate measurable improvement in answer quality
3. Establish baseline for comparing subsequent optimization techniques
4. Prove the value of context engineering
