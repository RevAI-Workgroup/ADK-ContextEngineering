# OpenTelemetry Tracing Configuration

tracing:
  # Service identification
  service_name: "context-engineering-sandbox"
  service_version: "1.5.0"
  
  # Exporter configuration
  # Options: "console" or "otlp"
  exporter_type: "otlp"
  
  # OTLP endpoint configuration
  # 
  # RECOMMENDED: Use OpenTelemetry Collector architecture:
  #   Application → OTLP Collector → Tempo (traces) + Prometheus/Grafana (metrics)
  #
  # Example setup:
  #   1. Deploy OTLP Collector (e.g., port 4317)
  #   2. Set otlp_endpoint to Collector: "otlp-collector-host:4317"
  #   3. Collector routes traces to Tempo and metrics to Prometheus
  #
  # DIRECT: Point directly to Tempo (traces only, metrics will use console):
  #   otlp_endpoint: "tempo-host:4333"
  #   metrics_exporter_type: "console"  # Tempo doesn't support metrics
  #
  # For gRPC: just "host:port" (no http:// prefix)
  # Example: "localhost:4317" for gRPC or "http://localhost:4318" for HTTP
  otlp_endpoint: "http://51.210.255.198:4333"
  otlp_insecure: true
  
  # Sampling rate (0.0 to 1.0)
  # 1.0 = sample all traces, 0.5 = sample 50% of traces
  sampling_rate: 1.0
  
  # Metrics export configuration
  # Both traces and metrics sent to OTLP Collector
  # Collector routes: traces → Tempo, metrics → Prometheus/Grafana
  metrics_exporter_type: "otlp"  # Options: "otlp" or "console"
  # metrics_endpoint defaults to same as otlp_endpoint when not specified (OTLP Collector pattern)
  # metrics_endpoint: "51.210.255.198:4333"  # Uncomment to use different endpoint
  metrics_otlp_insecure: true
  metrics_export_interval_ms: 5000
