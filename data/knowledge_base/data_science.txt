Data Science: Extracting Insights from Data

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, programming, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data. It involves collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting large volumes of data to support decision-making and solve complex problems.

THE DATA SCIENCE PROCESS

MACHINE LEARNING IN DATA SCIENCE

Supervised Learning
Classification:
- Predict categorical outcomes
- Binary classification (yes/no, true/false)
- Multi-class classification
- Examples: spam detection, disease diagnosis

Regression:
- Predict continuous values
- Linear regression, polynomial regression
- Examples: price prediction, sales forecasting

Unsupervised Learning
Clustering:
- Group similar data points
- K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN
- Applications: customer segmentation, image compression

Dimensionality Reduction:
- Reduce number of features
- PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
- Applications: visualization, feature extraction

MODEL EVALUATION METRICS

Classification Metrics:
- Accuracy: Overall correctness
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall (Sensitivity): True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- ROC curve and AUC
- Confusion matrix

Regression Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (coefficient of determination)
- Adjusted R-squared

BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES

When dealing with data too large for a single machine:

Apache Hadoop
- Distributed storage and processing
- MapReduce programming model
- HDFS file system

Apache Spark
